Requirements:

All nodes need python 3 (3.7) and golang (manual installation)

sudo apt-get install python3-pip

sudo pip install pipenv
pipenv install

All nodes need a manual installation of docker

All images based from arm32v6:
   - https://hub.docker.com/r/arm32v6/python/
   FROM arm32v6/python:3.7.3-alpine3.9
   - https://hub.docker.com/r/arm32v6/golang/
   FROM arm32v6/golang:1.12.4-alpine3.9

A merge to master should trigger re-pulling latest

Anything needing compilation should queue one automatically
